/* In this exercise we will explore string concatenation. String concatenation is joining strings together. You've already seen an example in a previous exercise, which uses the + operator to concatenate strings.

console.log("Hi, " + firstName);
Challenge
Use string concatenation to join the three provided strings (first, second, and third) and assign the resulting string to a variable called welcomeStatement. The value of welcomeStatement should be 'Welcome to the jungle!'*/

const first = "Welcome";
const second = "to the";
const third = "jungle!";

// ADD CODE BELOW
const welcomeStatement = first + " " + second + " " + third

// Uncomment the line below to check your work!
console.log(welcomeStatement);
