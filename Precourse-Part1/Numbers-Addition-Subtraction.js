/* Challenge: Numbers - Addition/Subtraction
Another type of value that can be stored in a variable is a number. Pay close attention to the fact that the number is not wrapped in quotes. Keep in mind that if a value is wrapped in quotes, it becomes a string.

let age = 26;  // age is a number
let ageText = "26";  // ageText is a string
Numbers can be added or subtracted using the addition (+) and subtraction (-) operators.

let sum = 2 + 2; 
console.log(sum); // should log: 4

let age = 30;
let tenYrsAgo = age - 10;
console.log(tenYrsAgo); // should log: 20
Challenge
Create a variable birthYear and set it equal to the year of your birth.

Next, create a variable named age and set the value to your current age.

Finally, create a variable named in10Yrs and set the value to equal your age plus 10. */

// ADD CODE BELOW
const birthYear = 1999;
const age = 22
const in10Yrs = age + 10;

// Uncomment these to check your work!
console.log(birthYear);
console.log(age);
console.log(in10Yrs);
