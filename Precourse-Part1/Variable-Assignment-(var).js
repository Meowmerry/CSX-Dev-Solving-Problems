Challenge
Now that we know what variables are, let's create one of our own. Below line 6, declare a variable named lastName and assign it the value of your last name. Make sure you wrap your name in quotation marks, e.g. "Smith". Here's another example in case:

var myName = "Kyle";
console.log(myName) // => "Kyle"
Now, go back to line 1 and modify the value of firstName to be your first name. Uncomment the console.log statement on line 10 and run your code; you should see Jenny replaced by your first nameâ€”unless your first name is Jenny, of course.

var firstName = "Jenny";
firstName = "Jonathan"
// Try un-commenting the line below
console.log("Hi, " + firstName)

// ADD CODE HERE
var lastName = "JavaScript"

// Uncomment the line below to check your work!
console.log("Hi, " + firstName + " " + lastName);
