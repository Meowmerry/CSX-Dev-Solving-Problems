/*ES6 & Template Literal
ECMAScript is a standardized version of JavaScript meant to unify the language's specifications and features. As all major browsers and JavaScript-runtimes follow this specification, the terms JavaScript and ECMAScript are interchangeable. ECMAScript 6 (ES6), released in 2015, brought about many new features to JavaScript which we will be exploring throughout this course. In this lesson we will focus on the template literal.

Template literals are a special type of string that make creating complex strings so much easier. Template literals are created by surrounding text between opening and closing backticks (``). Inside a template literal, you're able to refer to variables or execute code by using ${}. Take a look at the following example:

console.log(`10 + 25 = ${10 + 25}`) // => "10 + 25 = 35"
By wrapping the calculation 10 + 25 in the ${}, we are able to calculate the total right there inside of the string. We can also refer to specific variables in a template literal as well:

const firstName = 'Kyle';
const greeting = `Hi, ${firstName}!`;
console.log(greeting); // => "Hi, Kyle!"
Template literals also remove the need for escaped characters and string concatenation in many case as well. If you hit return, tab, etc inside of a template it will format the string in that form for you! You can also inject multiple variables into the same string.

const firstName = 'David';
const lastName = 'Bowie';
console.log(`My favorite artist is ${firstName} ${lastName}`) 
// => "My favorite artist is David Bowie"
Challenge
Declare 2 variables x & y, and set their values to any number you like. Next declare a constant solution which is a string that prints to the console like the example below:

let x = 2;
let y = 5;
const solution = <insert your code here>;
console.log(solution) // => "The sum of 2 and 5 is 7"
Hint: Don't forget the backticks (``)! */

// Declare 2 variables x & y that are Numbers
// Declare a string 'solution' that when printed to the console reads like:
// "The sum of <x> and <y> is <x + y>"
// ADD CODE BELOW
const x = 2;
const y = 5;
const solution = `The sum of ${x} and ${y} is ${x + y}`
console.log(solution)
