/* Declare a variable 'number' and set it to the value 10. */

/*
Create a function 'addNumbers' that takes a number as an argument. 'addNumbers' should add up all the numbers from 1 to the number you passed to the function.
For example, if the input is 4 then your function should return 10 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
*/

/*
Create a function "between50And500" that takes a number as an argument.
"between50And500" should return a true if the number passed to it is between 50 and 500 exclusive.
For example, if the input is 45 then your function should return false and if the input is 472 it should return true.
*/


/*
Create a function "divBy100" that takes a number as an argument.
"divBy100" should return a true if the number passed to it is divisible by 100.
For example, if the input is 120 then your function should return false and if the input is 600 it should return true.
*/


/*
Create a function "negativeOrEven" that takes a number as an argument.
"negativeOrEven" should return a true if the number passed to it is a negative number OR it is an even number.
For example, if the input is 7 then your function should return false and if the input is -3 it should return true.
*/



/*
Create a function "passAllTests" that takes an array of functions and another value as arguments.
Each function in your array will return a boolean value. "passAllTests" should pass your value argument to each function.
If all functions in your array return true then "passAllTests" will return true. Otherwise "passAllTests" should return false
*/



/*
Use your "passAllTests" function to test if the number 300 is greater than the number 50 and less than the number 500, divisible by the 100, and a negative number OR even. Then test the number 250.
*/




/*
Define a function "isPalindrome" that takes a string, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is a palindrome
(a palindrome is any string that has the same value when reversed - for example, "LEVEL" or "RACECAR")
*/


/*
Count recursively the total number of "abc" and "aba" substrings that appear in the given string.
countAbc("abc") → 1
countAbc("abcxxabc") → 2
countAbc("abaxxaba") → 2
*/


/*
Write a function 'stored' that takes in a function and returns a new function. The new function
will check if it has already computed the result for the given argument. If it hasn't, it will
run the passed-in function on the argument and return the result. If it has, it will return
the stored argument along with its result. If an argument is not a number, the new function
will not store the argument and instead return the error message "Please enter a valid number".

Ex:
const cube = (n) => n ** 3;
const cubeStored = stored(cube);
cubeStored(2) --> 8
cubeStored(2) --> '2: 8'
cubeStored(3) --> 27
cubeStored(3) --> '3: 27'
cubeStored('a') --> "Please enter a valid number"
cubeStored('a') --> "Please enter a valid number"
cubeStored(2) --> '2: 8'
