Challenge: For Loops - Fundamentals
Often times you'll find yourself needing to repeat the same operation over and over. While it's tempting to simply write out the logic by hand, there is a better way! Let's talk about iteration statements or loops. Loops will allow you to write a block of code once, and repeat the execution of the code for a given number of times. There are a few different kinds of iteration statements in Javascript - but for now we'll cover only the most basic one: a for loop.

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  // code to be repeated goes here
}
There are a few things going on here so let’s break this down. First off, we’re using the for keyword to tell JavaScript that we want to run a loop. Immediately after the for keyword, we’ll enclose a few conditions for the loop inside of a set of parentheses, separated by semicolons. for loops accept three conditions:

1. Initial Expression — this is simply a place for you to initialize any JavaScript expression (an expression is a bit of JavaScript code that evaluates to a single value). Most often, it’s used to declare a variable, in this case i, that will be used as a counter for how many times the loop iterates. You should definitely follow this pattern until you’re comfortable enough to try a more complex expression.

2. Conditional Expression — this should be a JavaScript expression that will evaluate to a true or false. In the example above, since i , which is currently set to 0 is indeed less than 10 , this will evaluate to true and execute the block of code inside of the curly braces {}. This condition is checked every time the loop runs, just before the code is executed. If this condition ever evaluates to false, the loop will stop and JavaScript will move on with executing code below it.

3. Increment Expression — this should be an expression that increments your loop counter as the loop runs. It will be executed after the code inside of the loop block is run. In the example above, i++ is shorthand for increasing the value of i by 1.

Finally, once you’ve declared your loop conditions, you can insert the code that you want to be repeated inside of the curly braces {}. Again this code will be executed until your condition (#2 above) evaluates to false.

Looping through Arrays
Now that we know how to write a loop, let's talk about how to loop through an array.

Remember, a value in an array can be accessed using the index of its position in the array: myArray[0]. With this in mind, we can utilize our loop counter, i to access each successive element in an array as the loop runs. Let's take a look at an example:

const myArray = ['string1', 'string2', 'string3'];

for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
  console.log( myArray[i] );
}
Let's break this down a bit. We've declared a variable myArray and have assigned it a value of an array containing a few strings.

Next, we've declared a for loop that will run as long as i is less than the length of the array (remember, we're incrementing i by 1 each time the loop runs). Now, since both the array's indexes and i start at 0 and increment by 1, we can effectively use i to lookup the elements in the array in order, where i will correspond to an index in the array.

Now that the idea of using i as an index has been established, inside of our loops code block we can reference the current element of an array like so: myArray[i].

Challenge
Using a for loop, decrement countDown by one each time the loop runs until it equals 0, making use of looping functionality instead of logging each number separately.*/
let countDown = 10;
// ADD CODE HERE
for (let i = countDown - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    countDown--
}
// Uncomment the below line to check your work
console.log(countDown) // -> should print 0;
