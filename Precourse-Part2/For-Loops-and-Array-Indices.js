/* Challenge: For Loops and Array Indices
You are given 3 different arrays, one of first names, last names and places. Imagine that each array element at a certain index corresponds to one user.

For example, my friends are Mary Snow, Kris Bowles, and Janelle Wong. I have two arrays, one of first names and one of last names. In order to get the full name of my friend, I need to access both arrays

const firstNames = ["Mary", "Kris", "Janelle"];
const lastNames = ["Snow", "Bowles", "Wong"];

console.log(firstNames[1]) // returns Kris
console.log(lastNames[1]) // returns Bowles
For this challenge, loop through the arrays and push a string with the format "My name is [firstName] [lastName] and I am from [place]" into the array holding the respective bios.

 */

const firstNames = ["Jon", "Arya", "Jamie"];
const lastNames = ["Snow", "Stark", "Lannister"];
const places = ["The Wall", "Winterfell", "Kings Landing"];


const bios = [];

// Loop through your arrays and store the following strings in the bios array:
// 'My name is Jon Snow and I am from The Wall'
// 'My name is Arya Stark and I am from Winterfell'
// 'My name is Jamie Lannister and I am from Kings Landing'

// ADD CODE HERE

for (let i = 0; i < firstNames.length; i++) {
    bios.push(`My name is ${firstNames[i]} ${lastNames[i]} and I am from ${places[i]}`)
}
console.log(bios)
